					<div class="title">How It Works</div>
					<h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
					<div class="qa">
						<p><strong>How far in advance should I order a SeriesKit?</strong></p>
						<p>We guarantee a 2 week turnaround. However many of our churches will get promotional materials like yard signs or posters printed professionally in advance to promote the new series. With that in mind, we generally recommend ordering 4 weeks out so you have two weeks with your finished SeriesKit before the first Sunday.</p>
					</div>
					<div class="qa">
						<p><strong>Can I get a discount?</strong></p>
						<p>Unfortunately, we can't offer a discount on a single SeriesKit for any reason. However, we do offer a bulk purchase. If you purchase a year's worth of SeriesKits (however many that is for your church) we offer a 25% discount.</p>
					</div>
					<div class="qa">
						<p><strong>Can I set up a recurring subscription?</strong></p>
						<p>Right now we don't offer any sort of recurring plan. Our main reason for this is that every church plans their series differently. Some churches do four week series, some eight, and some do a mix throughout the year. We would also hate to see you forget to use us one month and still get charged.</p>
					</div>
					<div class="qa">
						<p><strong>Can I get a SeriesKit faster?</strong></p>
						<p>We are working constantly to make our process as smooth, high-quality, and fast as possible. As we continue to refine the way we build SeriesKits, our turnaround guarantee will certainly drop. However we can't offer rush services at this time as we want to ensure a quality experience for every one of our churches.</p>
					</div>
					<div class="qa">
						<p><strong>Do you only work with churches?</strong></p>
						<p>We do only work for churches and have no plans to expand our offerings outside of the church world.</p>
					</div>
					<div class="qa">
						<p><strong>What image sizes do you offer?</strong></p>
						<p>Whatever you need. No, really. All of us at SeriesKit have had to deal with getting handed jpeg files that won't fill our screen, or images to small to put on the website. That's why as part of your SeriesKit we will make sure you get whatever size you need.</p>
