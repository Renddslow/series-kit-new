				<h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
				<div class="row">
					<div class="col-6">
						<div class="question">
							<h3>What does a SeriesKit include?</h3>
							<p>A SeriesKit is anything and everything you need to display, post, present, or print to make your next sermon series amazing. This includes sermon slides (key points, Bible verses, illustrations), posters, flyers, t-shirt designs, social media templates, lower-thirds graphics and any announcement graphics you need for this series.</p>
						</div>
					</div>
					<div class="col-6">
						<div class="question">
							<h3>How does designing a series work?</h3>
							<p>We start with the vision of the series: what is the goal, theme, or main Scripture for the series. From there will rough up a 3-4 basic poster concepts that we think captures what you're going for. Once you pick a concept you like, we're off to the races.</p>
						</div>
					</div>
				</div>
				<div class="row">
					<div class="col-6">
						<div class="question">
							<h3>When does the design process start?</h3>
							<p>We like to give at least a two week buffer between the start of the design process the first week of the series. This ensure that we have ample time to iron our all the kinks. But if you like to work further ahead, we're more than happy to be ahead of the game.</p>
						</div>
					</div>
					<div class="col-6">
						<div class="question">
							<h3>What are your business hours?</h3>
							<p>Our hours are 8am to 5pm Central Time. We are primarily located in Omaha, NE with teams in New York and Pennsylvania. We observe all federal United States holidays, but will honor a Saturday Night Special request up to the day of a major US holiday.</p>
						</div>

				<div class="row">
					<div class="col-6">
						<div class="question">
							<h3>What if my church only does 8 or fewer sermons in a year?</h3>
							<p>We've thought about this one a lot. We like the flat fee because it lets us focus on solving your design challenges without having to fuss with different fees. As such we like to think about a single SeriesKit equating to about 4 sermons per month. So if you have a month where you need 6 sermons, but cancel the following month, we will prorate you for the remaining 2 weeks.</p>
						</div>
					</div>
					<div class="col-6">
						<div class="question">
							<h3>What is a Saturday Night Special?</h3>
							<p>A Saturday Night Special is any <em>major</em> design revision or creation needed for <em>this</em> Sunday that is received after 5pm Central Time on a Friday, or 5pm Central Time the day before a major US Holiday. We do provide 1-2 free vouchers for such a request (plan permitting), and do have rare but unfortunately needed exceptions for serious emergency or tragedy (though we hope you never have to use it). We will assess a $50 fee per use of this service. <a href="#what-qualifies-an-sns">Read more</a> about what qualifies as a Saturday Night Special.</a></p>

							<h3>What happens after I sign up?</h3>
							<p>You will receive an email with instructions on how to get the ball rolling with your first SeriesKit. As soon as we get your reply we will start working to mockup our 3-4 concepts.</p>
						</div>
					</div>
					<div class="col-6">
						<div class="question">
							<h3>How long does a design revision usually take?</h3>
							<p>While we tend to work fast, expect any major revision to have a 24 hour turn-around. However rather isolated minor cosmetic changes can be expected within a few hours depending on the volume of revisions at the time.</p>

							<li>We have last minute changed the theme of the series/decided to do a one-off sermon.</li>
