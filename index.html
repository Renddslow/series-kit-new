		    <h2>What's My Investment?</h2>
		    <p>How much time each month do you spend worrying about graphic design assets from social media to Sunday morning sermon slides? How often do you find yourself in a creative rut and feel stuck creating the same graphic over and over again? How much time does building weekly graphics pull you away from the mission you were called to achieve? Not having a dedicated team focused on making incredible graphics for your sermon series could already be costing you more than you think.</p>
